# Changelog

This file records the versions released in repository history. Dates reflect the release commit date currently present in git history.

## Unreleased

## 0.9.19 - 2026-05-22

- Added a shared compact modal dialog foundation for workspace edit and confirmation flows.
- Converted project, task, Personal ToDo, user profile, and Local Accounts edit flows from dense inline editors to modal dialogs while preserving existing save, delete, conversion, movement, and role-based behavior.
- Replaced retention prune and backup restore/delete/clear browser confirmations with typed modal confirmations.
- Updated web regression coverage for the modalized edit and admin workflows.

## 0.9.18 - 2026-05-21

- Updated Prisma to 7.x with CLI datasource configuration in `prisma.config.ts` and PostgreSQL driver-adapter client initialization for the API and worker.
- Cleaned up lint issues surfaced by dependency refreshes so clean workspaces pass the current API and web lint configurations.
- Updated the Dockerfiles to install the pinned pnpm version directly and relink workspace dependencies after source copies so Node base images without Corepack still build.
- Fixed container image workflow validation so clean GitHub runners build shared package artifacts and generate the Prisma client before API lint and typecheck.
- Added build SHA and build date metadata to the Settings panel and passed that metadata through the image build workflow.

## 0.9.17 - 2026-05-13

- Added Revu-style lifecycle automation for Tavi container images, including Dependabot configuration, safe patch/minor dependency auto-merge, weekly GHCR image refreshes, Kubernetes pull-policy updates for refreshed `latest` images, and lifecycle documentation.

## 0.9.16 - 2026-05-08

- Ordered priority groups as `high`, `medium`, `low`, then `none` instead of relying on alphabetical or data insertion order.

## 0.9.15 - 2026-05-08

- Moved `Not viewed` and `Mark all viewed` into the `View` panel so the top workspace controls stay focused on search, grouping, and core actions.
- Scrolled project and task history panels into view automatically when their `History` actions are selected.

## 0.9.14 - 2026-05-07

- Added task-level viewed-state behavior, including the `Not viewed` workspace filter, live polling for collaborative updates, and clearer project/task highlight colors.
- Updated workspace filtering and density behavior so project `Status` filters remain project-level, `Assignee` filters include project owners and unassigned work, and the per-project `D` toggle hides both done and cancelled tasks.
- Cleaned up task/project flow details for empty `Unassigned` projects and opened a review follow-up draft when a task moves into `Review`.
- Refreshed notification branding so outbound emails use an email-safe Tavi HTML wrapper and logo.

## 0.9.13 - 2026-05-01

- Fixed local-account delete dependency checks so archived projects/tasks no longer make accounts look blocked by invisible assignments.
- Updated example workspace resets to use the fake default local accounts instead of arbitrary test users, creating missing defaults when needed.
- Ignored `.tmux*` workspace layout files.

## 0.9.12 - 2026-05-01

- Added per-user viewed-change tracking for projects and tasks, including subtle unviewed highlights, actor-aware audit-event detection, collapse-to-mark-viewed behavior, and a toolbar `Mark all viewed` action.
- Moved `Personal ToDo` into the User Profile panel and kept the top workspace toolbar focused on shared-workspace review actions.
- Added backup/restore coverage, Prisma persistence, API endpoints, web regression coverage, and documentation for viewed-state behavior.
- Added Kubernetes example NetworkPolicies that keep PostgreSQL reachable only from the Tavi API and worker pods, with deployment docs explaining when and how to apply them.

## 0.9.11 - 2026-04-23

- Added `infra/docker/up.sh` and `infra/docker/down.sh` as convenience wrappers for the published-image `compose-prod` local runtime.
- Made the new Docker helper scripts resolve their own directory before invoking Compose so they work reliably when launched from anywhere in the repo.

## 0.9.10 - 2026-04-22

- Fixed the Personal ToDo white-screen crash in the real browser drag flow by computing drop position before React clears the drag event target during state updates.
- Kept the Personal ToDo drag path aligned with the working project-task reorder behavior and added regression coverage for the live dragover/drop failure mode.

## 0.9.9 - 2026-04-22

- Renamed local-account `Reset Defaults` to `Restore Defaults` and added an admin-only `Clear all local accounts` action that requires the current password and preserves the signed-in account plus guest access.
- Fixed the Personal ToDo drag-and-drop reorder flow so browser-cleared drag state no longer leaves the page in a white-screen crash state.
- Updated assignee filtering so matching projects stay visible with their full task list instead of hiding sibling tasks that do not match the selected assignee.

## 0.9.8 - 2026-04-21

- Added guest access for local auth, including a login-screen `View as guest` path that auto-creates or repairs the dedicated `guest@tavi.local` viewer account.
- Added an admin `Guest Access` toggle in Settings and persisted the workspace-wide flag in `EmailSettings` with a Prisma migration.
- Hid guest-only restricted UI surfaces and blocked guest access to saved views, Personal ToDo, profile edits, and related user settings APIs so guest sessions stay read-only.

## 0.9.7 - 2026-04-21

- Redacted embedded SMTP passwords anywhere `SMTP_URL` reaches the web UI so admin diagnostics never display the raw secret.
- Masked SMTP credentials in test-email error banners, audit-notification rows, and copied notification-flow text while leaving the rest of the connection string visible for troubleshooting.

## 0.9.6 - 2026-04-21

- Consolidated outbound SMTP configuration around a single `SMTP_URL` connection string that now carries protocol, host, port, and optional credentials.
- Updated the API and worker mail transports to parse SMTP authentication directly from `SMTP_URL` and aligned the test-email diagnostics with the new configuration model.
- Moved Kubernetes SMTP examples to secret-backed `SMTP_URL` values and refreshed the Docker runtime examples and docs to match the new secret-based SMTP wiring.

## 0.9.5 - 2026-04-21

- Added a pinned `cloudnative-pg-install/` kustomization for the `infra/k8s/k8s-with-replicas-and-internal-ha-db/` variant and a root HA stack `kustomization.yaml` so CloudNativePG setup and the rest of the HA manifests are applied in the documented two-step flow.
- Updated Kubernetes deployment documentation to explain the CNPG operator install order, verification commands, and the cluster-scoped permissions required by the HA variant.
- Added project-search links to notification email bodies and synced the worker runtime env wiring so notification emails use the configured `SMTP_FROM`, `SMTP_URL`, and `TAVI_HOME_URL` values in Docker and Kubernetes deployments.

## 0.9.4 - 2026-04-20

- Buffered non-admin project and task notifications so users receive one hourly summary email, or one daily digest if they prefer daily delivery.
- Replaced the profile `Daily Digest` toggle with a `Notification Rate` selector and restricted daily send times to hourly values.
- Normalized legacy digest times in auth and backup flows, and filtered internal batched notification records out of the admin audit-notifications view.
- Release commit: `fc1cf2d`

## 0.9.3 - 2026-04-20

- Added `Demo` and `Review` workflow statuses, renamed `ToDo` to `Not Started`, and updated derived project-status rollups to match the new status model.
- Updated workspace filters, imports, saved views, and rollup behavior to support the new project and task statuses.
- Added `docs/DEVGUIDE.md` and refreshed the workspace, design, and architecture documentation around the updated status model.
- Release commit: `e9d79ab`

## 0.9.2 - 2026-04-20

- Refreshed product and operator documentation across architecture, design, settings, notifications, import/export, branding, and workspace guides.

- Release commit: `3f51ef2`

## 0.9.1 - 2026-04-20

- Polished the settings experience by tightening the audit-notification expander, removing duplicate email controls from audit changes, and refining CSV import panel copy and spacing.
- Made new-task notes multiline and expandable in the inline workspace add-task flow.
- Added corresponding web and audit test coverage for the settings and import/export refinements.
- Release commit: `df8b27f`

## 0.9.0 - 2026-04-20

- Added the retention settings panel for backup, login-log, change-log, and notification retention, including estimated sizes and prune-now actions.
- Added server-backed user configuration with browser sync, reset support, backup/restore coverage, and personal to-do retention preferences.
- Added forgot-password email reset, workspace search clear, project search-link copy, and additional workspace reset and rollup polish.
- Release commit: `e268952`
