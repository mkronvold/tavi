# Settings Guide

Tavi now splits personal controls from workspace administration:

1. `User Profile` opens from the signed-in user name in the header and holds self-service account editing plus personal preferences.
2. `Settings` stays visible only for admins and holds workspace-wide controls plus admin tools.

## Layout

Most launcher cards and audit cards are whole-card click targets. If a card opens another panel, that panel also has an explicit `Close` button in its header.

## User Profile

## Recommended use

1. Turn on `Auto Collapse` when you want only one project open during a live review.
2. Turn on `Bulk Actions` before doing large task cleanups.
3. Turn on `Full Width` when project titles, notes, references, or dense task tables need more horizontal space.
4. Turn on `Daily Digest` if you want one scheduled summary email instead of immediate task and project update, assignment, and due-date emails, then save the time shown in your browser's local timezone.
5. Leave `Task Drag Handles` on when editors should be able to manually reorder visible task lists, or turn it off for cleaner review-only sessions.
6. Use the `Import/Export` and `Backups` launcher cards when you need data-management tools without keeping those panels open all the time.
7. Use `Retention` when you want to prune stored backups or older login, change, and notification history based on the current policy estimates.

## Local Accounts entry point

`Local Accounts` opens the dedicated account-management panel documented in [`LOCAL_ACCOUNTS.md`](./LOCAL_ACCOUNTS.md).

Behavior depends on role:

1. Admins can manage all local accounts from `Settings`.
2. Non-admins use `User Profile` for their own name, email, and password changes instead.
3. Users who are locked out of local auth can use the login-screen `Forgot password` flow after one failed sign-in attempt to receive a one-time password by email and set a new password without opening `User Profile` first.

## Reset all user settings

`Reset all user settings` restores the current user's personal settings to defaults on the server and then clears the cached tavi copy in the current browser. That includes:

1. Theme
2. Auto Collapse
3. Bulk Actions
4. Full Width
5. Panel open or closed state
6. Per-project `Add Task` visibility
7. Per-project and personal `hide done` toggles
8. Per-user daily digest settings
9. Personal ToDo reminder and retention settings

It does not delete projects, tasks, imports, backups, accounts, or saved views.

## Related panels launched from Settings

1. [`IMPORT_EXPORT.md`](./IMPORT_EXPORT.md) covers exports, CSV import staging, import review, and workspace reset.
2. [`BACKUPS.md`](./BACKUPS.md) covers scheduled backups, backup-now, upload, restore, download, and delete.
3. [`LOCAL_ACCOUNTS.md`](./LOCAL_ACCOUNTS.md) covers local-auth account management.
4. [`AUDIT_HISTORY.md`](./AUDIT_HISTORY.md) covers audit timelines and filters.

## Non-obvious behavior

1. Saved views are not the same as personal settings. Resetting user settings does not delete saved views from the server.
2. `User History` is for the current user identity, not a full system-wide audit report.
3. `Daily Digest` applies only to non-admin notification emails. Administrative account emails still send immediately when global email is enabled, and password-reset emails still send whenever SMTP is configured even if `Email Notifications` is off.
4. Admin-only email controls do not force users into digest mode or pick a send time for them. Each user chooses whether non-admin notifications arrive immediately or in the daily digest and saves their own digest time.
5. New users default to digest off and a stored UTC digest time of `11:00`, which corresponds to `5:00 AM` CST.
6. `Personal ToDo` opens from `User Profile` after the account card. Its `hide done` preference is still reset by `Reset all user settings`.
7. `Audit Changes` intentionally excludes outbound email-delivery steps. Use `Audit Notifications` when you need the notification timeline or test-email diagnostics.
