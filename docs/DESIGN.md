# Tavi Design Specification

> Tavi is our lightweight system for tracking work and projects clearly, without slowing teams down.

## 1. Product Summary

Tavi is an internal web application for managing project work as first-class projects and tasks. It replaces Loop as the primary tracker and turns checklist-style work into structured tasks with explicit status, ownership, due dates, and rollup behavior.

The product is optimized for review-heavy team workflows where people need to scan many projects quickly, regroup the view during discussions, and understand project health from task state instead of ad hoc notes or checklists.

## 2. Product Goals

1. Replace checklist-driven project tracking with explicit project and task records.
2. Make project status trustworthy by deriving it from task status and exposing rollup details.
3. Support fast review conversations with compact layouts, inline editing, and collapse/expand controls.
4. Make large worklists manageable through filtering, sorting, regrouping, and saved views.
5. Provide a practical migration path from existing Loop exports.

## 3. Non-Goals for v1

1. Arbitrary nested tasks beyond one task level under each project.
2. Bi-directional synchronization with Loop.
3. Mobile-first task management UX.
4. External customer or guest collaboration.
5. Broad portfolio analytics beyond operational status views.

## 4. Intended Users

| Role | Primary Use | Permissions |
|---|---|---|
| Admin | Configure access, manage local accounts, manage imports, resolve data issues | Full access, role assignment, local account management, import administration, export of visible data, archive/restore |
| Editor | Create and manage project/task data | Create, edit, regroup, update status, save views, export visible data |
| Viewer | Follow progress and join reviews | Read-only access to projects, tasks, and saved views, plus export of visible data |

## 5. Core Domain Model

### Project

A project is the top-level tracking unit. It represents a deliverable, initiative, or workstream.

Recommended fields:

- Title
- Owner
- Due date
- Priority
- Labels/tags
- Derived status
- Optional manual status override
- Notes
- Source metadata for imports
- Created at / updated at / archived at

### Task

A task is a first-class work item directly attached to a project. Tasks are not nested beyond one level in v1.

Recommended fields:

- Title
- Notes
- Assignee
- Due date
- Priority
- Status
- Labels/tags
- Sort order within the project
- Created at / updated at / completed at
- Source metadata for imports

In this phase, task notes absorb the prior task description and blocked-reason concepts into a single general-purpose field.

### Saved View

A saved view stores a named combination of:

- Search text
- Grouping mode
- Task-status filters
- Task-assignee filters
- Expanded/collapsed defaults for the grouped workspace

Milestone 4A scope:

- Saved views are personal only.
- Team/shared views are deferred.
- Visible columns, density, and other future display settings are deferred.

Panel toggle state for View, Import/Export, New Project, Settings, and per-project Add Task is browser-local UI state and is not part of saved views.
Theme mode, Auto Collapse, Bulk Actions visibility, and Full Width are also browser-local preferences and are not part of saved views.

### Import Job

An import job records a Loop CSV or export-based migration event, including validation results, row mappings, and completion status.

### Audit Event

An audit event records meaningful changes such as status changes, task reordering, field edits, overrides, and imports.

## 6. Status Model

### Task Statuses

Recommended task statuses:

- `todo`
- `in_progress`
- `blocked`
- `on_hold`
- `done`
- `canceled`

### Project Statuses

Recommended project statuses:

- `not_started`
- `in_progress`
- `blocked`
- `on_hold`
- `done`

### Project Rollup Rules

Default project status is auto-calculated from task state.

1. If a manual override is active, show the override status and keep the derived status visible for context.
2. If the project has no active tasks, set status to `not_started`.
3. If all non-canceled tasks are `done`, set status to `done`.
4. If all actionable tasks are `blocked`, set status to `blocked`.
5. If all actionable tasks are `on_hold`, set status to `on_hold`.
6. If all non-canceled tasks are `todo`, set status to `not_started`.
7. Otherwise set status to `in_progress`.

Override requirements:

- Only admins and editors can set or clear an override.
- An override can optionally be paired with project notes, but notes are not required.
- The UI must always indicate when a displayed project status is overridden instead of derived.

Rollup details shown in the UI should include:

- Total task count
- Counts by task status
- Overdue task count
- Completion ratio

## 7. Core User Workflows

### 7.1 Create a Project

1. User creates a project with core metadata.
2. User adds tasks inline or through a project detail drawer/page.
3. Project appears in the main grouped list with an initial derived status.

### 7.2 Import Existing Work from Loop

1. Admin uploads a Loop export or CSV.
2. System validates required columns and previews the mapping.
3. System fans newline-delimited checklist entries into separate staged tasks under the mapped project, while rows with an empty mapped checklist cell remain project-only.
4. If imported assignees or extra multi-owner project contacts do not exist, preview offers local user creation when name and email are available.
5. Preview shows per-row overlap decisions for existing projects and tasks so the admin can update, add, or ignore overlaps before commit.
6. User confirms the import after resolving missing users that block commit.
7. Import results show successes, skipped rows, and validation failures.

### 7.3 Export Current Workspace

1. User opens the Import/Export panel.
2. User exports the current filtered workspace view as CSV, XLSX, or JSON, or selects the Loop export shape.
3. Export respects the viewer's current access and filter state.

### 7.4 Reset Workspace Examples

1. Admin opens the Import/Export panel and starts Reset all Projects/Tasks.
2. Tavi requires the admin to re-enter the current local password before continuing.
3. System deletes the current project/task workspace data and seeds a small example workspace without touching local accounts, saved views, or import history.

### 7.5 Daily Review / Standup

1. User opens a saved view or applies filters.
2. User groups projects by owner, status, due date bucket, or label.
3. User collapses unrelated groups and expands the project under discussion.
4. User updates task status and notes inline during the review.
5. Project rollup updates immediately.

### 7.6 Exception Handling

1. User marks a task blocked and updates notes if context is needed.
2. Project rollup reflects the change.
3. If the derived project status does not match the team's desired display state, an editor or admin can apply a manual override and optionally update project notes.

### 7.7 Manage Local Accounts

1. Admin opens Settings and expands the Local Accounts panel.
2. Admin can export local accounts as JSON for review or bulk editing. Exported JSON omits passwords.
3. Admin can import JSON to create or update accounts by email. Existing accounts keep their current password when the imported password field is blank, and new accounts must include a password.
4. Admin can reset the default `admin@tavi.local`, `editor@tavi.local`, and `viewer@tavi.local` accounts back to `password123` without deleting unrelated local accounts.
5. The login hint for the default local users returns only after the backend confirms those seeded accounts exist with their default credentials again.

## 8. Functional Requirements

### FR-01 Authentication and Access

- Production access uses enterprise SSO via OIDC or SAML.
- Local development uses a simpler local auth mode.
- Local auth must support admin-managed local accounts plus self-service password changes.
- Admin local-account management must support JSON export, JSON or CSV import by email, duplicate handling during import, and reset-to-default for the seeded `@tavi.local` accounts.
- The login screen must show the seeded local-user hint only when the backend confirms the default `@tavi.local` accounts still exist with their default password.
- Authorization must enforce admin/editor/viewer roles.

### FR-02 Project Management

- Users can create, edit, archive, restore, and view projects.
- Projects must support due dates, owners, labels, notes, and priority.
- Project notes are a general field and are not required to set manual status overrides.
- Soft deletion or archiving is preferred over hard deletion in v1.

### FR-03 Task Management

- Users can create, edit, reorder, and archive tasks within a project.
- Tasks must support assignee, due date, priority, status, labels, and notes.
- Tasks exist only under a project in v1.

### FR-04 Dense Primary Workspace

- The default workspace is a dense grouped list/table.
- The workspace must display both project rows and task rows.
- Expand/collapse must work at both group and project levels.
- Settings must allow Auto Collapse so opening one project can collapse the others when the user wants a single-project focus mode.
- Settings must allow Bulk Actions to be shown or hidden so task-selection checkboxes can stay out of the way when multi-select editing is not needed.
- Settings must allow Full Width so the workspace can expand past the default centered reading width on large screens.
- Search, grouping, task-status, and assignee controls should float left without a framed card.
- Compact toggle buttons for View, Import/Export, New Project, and Settings should float to the right on the same row when space allows.
- Per-project Add Task UI should stay hidden behind a lightweight toggle until needed.

### FR-05 Inline Editing

- Core project and task fields must be editable inline without navigating away.
- Inline edits should preserve context and avoid full-page reloads.
- New-task and inline-task editing controls should align to the visible task-table columns.
- Edit and History row actions should stay compact and right-justified.
- Projects must support optional References metadata that accepts one newline-delimited reference per line, with each line allowing either a URL or plain reference text.

### FR-06 Sorting, Filtering, and Regrouping

- Users can sort, filter, and regroup by owner, assignee, status, due date, priority, and label.
- Filters and grouping state should persist locally in the browser and be savable as named views.

### FR-07 Rollup and Summary Indicators

- Project status is derived from tasks by default.
- The UI must display rollup counts and completion progress alongside each project.
- Project rows should show completion percentage without requiring expansion.
- Manual overrides must remain visible and auditable.

### FR-08 Saved Views

- Users can save personal workspace views.
- Milestone 4A views persist search, grouping, task-status filtering, task-assignee filtering, and
  expanded/collapsed defaults.
- Team/shared views and future display preferences remain out of scope for this
  pass.
- Panel toggle state is persisted locally in the browser, not in saved views.

### FR-09 Search

- Users can search across project titles, project notes, task titles, task notes, owners, assignees, and labels.

### FR-10 Import and Export

- v1 must support CSV or export-based import from Loop.
- Import must provide preview, validation, and error reporting.
- Imported checklist items become tasks in the destination project.
- Newline-delimited checklist cells in Loop exports must create one task per checklist entry.
- Rows with a blank mapped checklist/task-title value must stay valid project-only rows, even when shared task mappings such as status or priority are present.
- Missing imported assignees must be surfaced before commit, with an admin path to create local viewer accounts and generated passwords when email data is present.
- The Import/Export panel must also provide CSV, XLSX, and JSON exports of the current filtered workspace view plus a Loop-oriented export shape.
- The Import/Export panel must provide an admin-only Reset all Projects/Tasks action that requires current-password confirmation and reseeds a small example workspace.
- Export must be available to all authenticated users for the data they can see.

### FR-11 Audit History

- Meaningful project and task changes must be auditable.
- Minimum audit events: create, edit, status change, reorder, override, import, archive/restore.

### FR-12 Bulk Actions

- Editors and admins should be able to bulk-update common fields such as assignee, due date, label, and status for selected tasks.

### FR-13 Accessibility

- Keyboard navigation is required for row navigation and inline edits.
- Status indicators must not rely on color alone.
- Table controls and row actions must remain screen-reader accessible.

### FR-14 Performance

- The primary workspace should remain responsive with large grouped lists.
- Expanding, collapsing, filtering, and inline edits must feel immediate in normal use.

## 9. UX Requirements

### Interaction Model

- Desktop-first experience optimized for review conversations and operational tracking.
- Compact row density with minimal visual chrome.
- Secondary actions should be visually quiet until hover or focus.
- Common edits should happen inline or in lightweight drawers/modals.
- Theme mode should be switchable between light and dark in Settings and persist per browser.

### Visualization Requirements

- Group headers must show counts and the active grouping context.
- Project rows must show rollup progress without requiring expansion.
- Task rows must be easy to scan with stable column alignment.
- Users must be able to collapse unrelated content quickly to focus the discussion.

### Layout Requirements

- Support sticky top controls and stable columns for large lists.
- Preserve user column preferences where practical.
- Keep filters and grouping controls compact and close to the data.

### Responsiveness

- v1 should target desktop and large laptop screens first.
- Smaller screens may support read/update workflows, but full dense-table management is not a v1 priority.

## 10. Business Rules

1. Every task belongs to exactly one project.
2. Projects support only one task level in v1.
3. Archived projects and tasks are hidden from default views but recoverable.
4. Task notes are available regardless of status, and blocked tasks do not require a dedicated blocked-reason field.
5. Manual project status overrides remain auditable and do not require notes.
6. Imported records should preserve source metadata for traceability.
7. Panel toggle state should persist locally per browser and be clearable without removing unrelated site data.
8. Exports should only include data visible to the authenticated user at export time.
9. Theme mode, Auto Collapse, Bulk Actions visibility, and Full Width preferences should persist locally per browser and not affect saved views.
10. References are optional project metadata stored as newline-delimited entries. URL values should open externally rather than embedding another tracker inside Tavi, display without protocol/query/fragment noise, and plain-text entries should remain visible as metadata.

## 12. Suggested Supporting Documents

To reduce ambiguity before implementation, the following supporting docs are recommended after [`DESIGN.md`](./DESIGN.md) and [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](./ARCHITECTURE.md) are accepted:

1. `docs/UX-FLOWS.md` for annotated workflows and wireframes of the dense workspace, import flow, and inline editing states.
2. `docs/API-CONTRACT.md` for concrete request/response shapes and error models.
3. `docs/DATA-DICTIONARY.md` for field definitions, enums, and validation rules.
4. [`IMPORT-MAPPING.md`](./IMPORT-MAPPING.md) for the Loop export format, column mapping, and migration rules.
5. `docs/EXPORT-FORMATS.md` for CSV, XLSX, JSON, and Loop export shapes.
6. `docs/LOCAL-AUTH-ADMIN.md` for local account lifecycle rules and role-based settings behavior.
7. `docs/OPS-RUNBOOK.md` for deployment, rollback, and operational procedures.
8. `adr/` entries for major architectural decisions that may evolve during implementation.
9. [`BRANDING.md`](./BRANDING.md) for canonical naming, stylized display usage, and first-use product copy.

## 13. Reference Alignment

TrackForge and current Loop screenshots should be used during UI review to validate layout density, row hierarchy, and control placement before implementation begins. They are reference inputs for interaction quality, not the source of truth for the product model.

Store reference screenshots under `references/screenshots/` using descriptive filenames so the design discussion can cite them directly as new examples are added.
